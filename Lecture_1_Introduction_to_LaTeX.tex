\section{ What is \TeX?}
\frametitle{ What is \TeX?}
\begin{itemize}\justifying
	\item A low-level markup and programming language created by \textbf{Donald Knuth} to
	typeset documents attractively and consistently.
	\item Programming language- 
	\begin{itemize}\justifying
		\item Supports the if-else construct: you can make calculations with it (that
		are performed while compiling the document), etc.
		\item Find it very hard to do
		anything else but typesetting with it.
	\end{itemize}
\item Very gradual learning curve, requiring
a significant investment of time to build custom macros for text formatting.

\frametitle{ What is \LaTeX?}
\begin{itemize}\justifying
	\item Pre-built macros are time saving, and automate certain repetitive tasks and
	help reduce user introduced errors; however, this convenience comes at the cost of complete
	design flexibility. 
	\item One of the most popular macro packages is called \LaTeX

 \frametitle{Why \LaTeX \hspace{1pt} Over Word Processors?}
\begin{itemize}\justifying
	\item Manual formatting of a document,
	as usually required in many word processors, can be automated in \LaTeX. 
	\item Possibility of doing any mistake in numbering and referring items (sections,
	tables, figures or equations), in choosing size and type of fonts for different sections
	and subsections, or in preparing bibliographic references, can be avoided. 
	\item Has the provision for automatically generating various lists of contents, index,
	and glossary.

		shape and 10 pt size. 
		\item The sizes of fonts in different parts of a document, say in headings and in paragraphs, are calculated proportionately.
		\item The default font setting can be altered globally through various options
		to the 
		\begin{verbatim}
		\documentclass[ ]{ }
		\end{verbatim} command, e.g.,
