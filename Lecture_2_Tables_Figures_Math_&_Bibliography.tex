		\item \LaTeX{} by default recognizes ``table" and ``figure" floats.
		\item Positioned in a part of the page to themselves (top, middle, bottom, left, right, or wherever the designer specifies). 
		\item They always have a caption describing them and they are always numbered so they can be referred to from elsewhere in the text. 
		\item LaTeX automatically floats Tables and Figures, depending on how much space is left on the page at the point that they are processed. If there is not enough room on the current page, the float is moved to the top of the next page.
